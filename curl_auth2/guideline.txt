# OAuth 2.0 Flows Implementation Guide

## Project Objective
Gain a practical understanding of the different OAuth 2.0 flows by reproducing them step-by-step using `curl` commands â€” without relying on SDKs or libraries.

## Tools Required
- Terminal with `curl` installed
- Any OAuth2-compliant Identity Provider (e.g. Keycloak, Auth0, or mock server like `https://oidcdebugger.com`)
- A test client and a test user (provided by the instructor or set up yourself)

## Flows to Implement

### 1. Authorization Code Flow
### 2. Authorization Code Flow with PKCE
### 3. Client Credentials Flow
### 4. Resource Owner Password Credentials (ROPC) Flow
### 5. (Optional/Bonus): Device Authorization Flow

## Expected Deliverables
Each student must submit:
- A Markdown file (oauth2-flows.md) or PDF with:
  - Step-by-step curl commands per flow
  - Responses (formatted JSON, tokens, status codes)
  - A brief explanation of what happened at each step
- Optional: A shell script that automates one or more flows

## Success Criteria
- Proper understanding of when and how each flow is used
- Successful reproduction of at least 3 flows
- Ability to explain the security model behind each flow
